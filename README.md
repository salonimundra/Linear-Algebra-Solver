# Linear Algebra Solver #

This is a small application that helps you solve system of linear equations. It takes in Matrix A and Matrix B from the user and calculates Matrix X according to AX=B.

### How to start the application? ###

* Execute scripty.sh by running following command in terminal window
``` 
./scripty.sh
```
* The application will automatically get compiled and it will open

### How to use the application? ###
* Enter the value of no.of equations in the system to be solved. This value should be given in n
* Enter all the coefficients of variables of system of linear equations in Matrix A
* Similarly fill the entries in Matrix B
* Click on solve
* The results, i.e., the value of variables will be generated in output Matrix X
